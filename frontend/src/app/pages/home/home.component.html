      <h3>Discover Korea – Language Meets Culture</h3>

      <p>
        Korean isn’t just a language – it’s a living reflection of one of the world’s most vibrant and dynamic cultures. 🇰🇷  
        From the poetic beauty of Hangeul, the scientifically crafted Korean alphabet developed in the 15th century by King Sejong,  
        to the modern-day phenomenon of Hallyu – the Korean Wave – Korea has captivated hearts around the globe.  
        Whether through emotional K-Dramas, the irresistible beats of K-Pop, award-winning cinema,  
        or soul-warming dishes like kimchi and tteokbokki, Korean culture continues to grow in influence and depth. 
      </p>

      <p>
        But language is the bridge – and learning Korean means more than just memorizing words.  
        It’s about understanding a culture shaped by values like respect, community, and resilience.  
        It’s about greeting someone with a bow and a warm “안녕하세요”, reading signs on the streets of Seoul,  
        ordering your favorite dish in a traditional hanok restaurant, or understanding the lyrics of your favorite song without subtitles.  
        Whether you're planning to travel, study, work in Korea, or simply connect with its people and stories,  
        mastering the language opens doors to genuine, meaningful experiences.
