  <h1>Welcome to <span class="highlight">SeoulSpeak</span> – your gateway to Korea!</h1>

  <p>
    Korean isn’t just a language – it’s a living reflection of one of the world’s most vibrant and dynamic cultures. 🇰🇷  
    From the poetic beauty of <strong>Hangeul</strong>, the scientifically crafted Korean alphabet developed in the 15th century by King Sejong,  
    to the modern-day phenomenon of <strong>Hallyu</strong> – the Korean Wave – Korea has captivated hearts around the globe.  
    Whether through emotional <strong>K-Dramas</strong>, the irresistible beats of <strong>K-Pop</strong>, award-winning cinema,  
    or soul-warming dishes like <em>kimchi</em> and <em>tteokbokki</em>, Korean culture continues to grow in influence and depth. 🌏🎶🍲

    But language is the bridge – and learning Korean means more than just memorizing words.  
    It’s about understanding a culture shaped by values like respect, community, and resilience.  
    It’s about greeting someone with a bow and a warm “안녕하세요”, reading signs on the streets of Seoul,  
    ordering your favorite dish in a traditional <em>hanok</em> restaurant, or understanding the lyrics of your favorite song without subtitles.  
    Whether you're planning to travel, study, work in Korea, or simply connect with its people and stories,  
    mastering the language opens doors to genuine, meaningful experiences. 🗺️🫶
